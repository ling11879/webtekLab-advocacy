However, in this era, you may be asking yourself this exact question: WHY SHOULD I CARE? After all, it doesnt really concern you at the present moment. However, in reality, the comfort youre feeling right now is probably because the value of human rights. The rights to not be discriminated, to be protected by the law, to be treated fairly in court and even the right to trial are some of the many rights that every human being is entitled to.
