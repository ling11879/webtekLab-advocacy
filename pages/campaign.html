                    <h5>Are Criminals Still Entitled To Human Rights?</h5>
                    
                    <p class="indented">Thieves, murderers, drug lords, etc. are some of the criminals in the country. President Rodrigo has a strong campaign against crimes especially on drugs. Police have reported killing 2,555 people since Duterte took office seven months ago, and immediately launched his war on crime, while nearly 4,000 others have died in unexplained circumstances, according to official figures.</p>
                    <p class="indented">     Are these people, criminals as they say, still entitled to human rights? According to the 1987 constitution of the republic of the Philippines under article III, no person shall be deprived of life. </p>
                    <p class="indented">
                        The aim is good since it intends to eliminate drug-related crimes in our country. However, these criminals are still people; individuals who have family and children to support. They have to stop the killings. Instead of killing them, why not give the proper and  justifiable punishments? These people are still human beings who has every right to live. </p>
