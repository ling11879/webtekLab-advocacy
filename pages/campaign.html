                    <p class="indented campaign">Do we really know the importance of our human rights? Have you ever thought of the things you <strong>CAN'T</strong> do without those rights? It's as simple as not being able to post a status in Facebook that speaks your mind. Why? The right to freedom of speech enables us to do such things. Most of the youth today, and possibly not even some adults, are not even aware or are having lack of knowledge on what our human rights are as persons. </p>
                    <p class="indented campaign">It is a must that we have a sufficient understanding on what the Bill Of Rights is. It can be found in the "Laws" page of this website. Just click the Laws button in the navigation bar on the top of this page!</p>
                    <p class="indented campaign">Beside this paragraph, in this blog you are reading right now, is a brief but concise image that presents the <em>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights</em> which applies to every single person in the world! Take time to read it and read the Bill of Rights of the Philippines then digest the information. Now, do you realize the <strong>importance</strong> of our human rights? Ask yourself, what would the Phillipines be like if we don't have these rights? Pretty chaotic isn't it? It may result to slavery,  corruption, disrespect toone another etc.</p>
                    <p class="indented campaign">It is <strong>important</strong> that we, as a nation, should <strong>NOT ABUSE</strong> our rights. We should be advocates of human rights and it all starts with ourselves! Help us promote human rights! The endeavour of having a better world can be achieved if we start now. Everyone is indeed equal, in every aspect.</p>

                    <h5>Are Criminals Still Entitled To Human Rights?</h5>
                    
                    <p class="indented campaign">Thieves, murderers, drug lords, etc. are some of the criminals in the country. President Rodrigo has a strong campaign against crimes especially on drugs. Police have reported killing 2,555 people since Duterte took office seven months ago, and immediately launched his war on crime, while nearly 4,000 others have died in unexplained circumstances, according to official figures.</p>
                    <p class="indented campaign">     Are these people, criminals as they say, still entitled to human rights? According to the 1987 constitution of the republic of the Philippines under article III, no person shall be deprived of life. </p>
                    <p class="indented campaign">
                        The aim is good since it intends to eliminate drug-related crimes in our country. However, these criminals are still people; individuals who have family and children to support. They have to stop the killings. Instead of killing them, why not give the proper and  justifiable punishments? These people are still human beings who has every right to live. </p>
